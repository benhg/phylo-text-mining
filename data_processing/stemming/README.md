# Stemming

An important part of this project is going to be "stemming". In the linguistic version of the LDA, what this means is to find all words that have the same semantic value, and ensure that they're treated the same way.

In our genetic version, what we want to do is to find all proteome motifs that have the same "meaning" - referring in this case to functional value. 

The code in that module will help us with our stemming.
